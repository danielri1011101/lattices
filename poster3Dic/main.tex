        \section{Quantum-safe Cryptography}
        Shor's quantum algorithm, published in 1994, demonstrated that factorization-based cryptography is no longer safe in the scenario of widespread availability of quantum computers.

        \[
    S_{i,j} =
        \begin{array}{ccccccc}
           \          & \      & |00\rangle & |01\rangle & |10\rangle & |11\rangle & \ \\
           |00\rangle & \vline & 1          & 0          & 0          & 0          & \vline\\

           |10\rangle & \vline & 0          & 0          & 1          & 0          & \vline\\

    There is an \textbf{urgent} need for quantum-safe encryption protocols
    
    \vspace{1cm}

    %This begs the question of quantum-safe encryption protocols, for which \emph{the more, the better} rule applies.

    %For instance, the SIDH(KE) protocol was broken in 2022 by an efficient classical algorithm. ----> Have this to mention verbally, as I present the poster.

    % NIST standardization process, and its motivations.



    In 2015, the NSA announced its transition to quantum-resistant algorithms, in recognition of threats such as:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Harvesting attacks: store today's keys and cyphertexts to break later.
        \item Forging signatures for old keys.
        \item Implementing new cryptography at scale takes a long time.
    \end{enumerate}

     \vspace{0.2cm}

     
    \includegraphics[width=0.29\textwidth]{nistComputerSecurity.png}

     Thus began NIST's \emph{PQC standardization} process in 2016, with the following algorithms being winners as of August 2024: \emph{CRYSTALS-kyber, CRYSTALS-dilithium, SPHINCS+ and FALCON.}

    \section{Lattice-based cryptography} Of the 4 selected standards, 3 of them rely on Lattice algebra. There is a concern about optimizing the security-level/runtime ratio. \blindtext
    

    \section{Modern algebra} Advances in mathematics often tend to both simplify and unify seemingly distant theories, as exemplified by the developement of Category Theory since 1945.

    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{tikzcd}
            G \arrow{d}{\nu} \arrow{r}{\alpha} & H \arrow{d}{\mu} \\
            G/G' \arrow{r}{\beta}              & H/H'
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{equation*}

    \bigskip

    Therefore, with a sufficiently general language, we may attempt to simplify sequences of operations such as those of an encryption scheme. One of such languages is that of operads, whose objects represent \emph{operation composition}.

    \includegraphics[width=0.29\textwidth]{fig1Intromss02.png}

    Moreover, the fact that standards such as \emph{CRYSTALS-kyber} rely on module theory suggests that applying the aforementioned algebra can yield advantageous simplifications of the current schemes, at least as far as expressing them is concerned.

    % Maybe mention that modern crypto, such as CRYSTALS-Kyber, use module theory? (M_LWE)

    \section{Functional programming} The implementations of the currently selected protocols are written in unsafe languages, such as C and Python. 

    \bigskip
    
    \includegraphics[width=0.22\textwidth]{haskellLogo.png}

    \bigskip
    
    Meanwhile, functional languages such as Haskell allow programmers to define category-theoretic abstractions in terms of their type system, in a way that is mathematically clear and natural.

    \includegraphics[width=0.29\textwidth]{fctrHskExl.png}

    In this way, we strive for creating the language SILVER, which shall have the properties of \textbf{expressibility, safety,} and \textbf{maintainability}.
