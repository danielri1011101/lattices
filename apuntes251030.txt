-I- What is omSVP about?
-II- How does it relate to hawk's math, specifically $K_n/R_n$?

-*- If the analogous pair of questions is easier to answer for smLIP, then prepare that.

-- According to ss 1.0.1, omSVP and smLIP are to be found in 2 or 6.

-*- ss 2 consists of high-level pseudocode of the main hawk algorithms.

-- 6.2, 6 linear, ---break--- 2 linear.

-- Can any cm field be (algorithmically) recovered as a cyclotomic field?

-- Is the ring of integers $R$ of a given cm $K$ also algorithmically recoverable?
