[REVIEW]

-- Last time: high-level algorithm for key generation.

-- Started reading ss 6.2 about omSVP.

-- average case omSVP is the problem considered.

-?- Idea of omSVP is to find a non-trivial new short vector. Short with respect to
a Q-norm, where Q is a sampled positive-definite Hermitian matrix of rank r with
coefficients in K, a cm field given by
	K= QQ[X]/<X^n + 1>,
where QQ denotes the field of rational numbers and n= 2^m.
The parameters r and m are functions of the security parameter.
The new short vector xx of rank r is to have coefficients in
	R= ZZ[X]/<X^n + 1>,
the ring of integers of K.
The challenge is to accomplish it from data of the form
J <--iid-- D_{\sigma, Q}
where D denotes the discrete Gaussian distribution.
The adversary can use the vector J (which he can iteratively sample) together with 
the fixed data Init= <Q, \mu_K, L, \sigma> where \mu_K is the set of roots of unity
of K.
